### I created this website to study and practice my first responsive site, and make it using Bootstrap framework. It will be about a to-watch/watched films, and a film lists creator.

## PROGRESS 
### Nowadays I'm almost finishing the front-end part; in the future, I intend to make a simple CRUD back-end.

## CONTRIBUTIONS 
This project will be only to learning purpose, so, if you can help me with suggestion, tips, or pullrequest, you are welcome.
